HOOP DREAMS — UI PATCH v2 (NO REBUILD)

Modify the current project in place. Keep all visuals/colors/pixel bg. No console errors. Mobile-first.

GOALS
1) Clean Home quick tiles: add Dash + News; keep Inbox in-game only.
2) Replace +1w with pixel “>>” Sim control + modal.
3) Fix Settings-from-Main-Menu so it never auto-starts a game.
4) Ensure stats strip never overlaps bottom tabs (safe-area aware).

CHANGES

MAIN MENU
- Show only: Play, Load / Continue, Roster Editor, Settings.
- REMOVE Inbox from Main Menu (Inbox is in-game only).

SETTINGS BEHAVIOR (BUG FIX)
- If user opens Settings from Main Menu AND no active save:
  - Open a no-save Settings screen (reuse /settings with noSaveMode=true OR create /menu-settings).
  - Edit only hd:settings (theme, sound). Do NOT touch save slots or hd:activeSlot.
  - On exit, return to Main Menu. Do NOT redirect to /home.
- “Manage Saves” from this screen goes to /load without auto-continue.

ROUTE GUARDS (REQUIRE ACTIVE SAVE)
- Guard these routes: /home, /league, /team, /social, /inbox, /news, /dash
- If hd:activeSlot === null → redirect to /load (or /new) and show toast: “Create or load a player to continue.”

HOME QUICK TILES (MIDDLE ROW)
- EXACT set: Standings → /league?tab=standings
             Schedule → /league?tab=schedule
             Dash     → /dash
             News     → /news
- REMOVE Team and Social from this row (they exist in bottom tabs).

NEW DASH PAGE (PLACEHOLDER HUB)
- Route: /dash
- Grid cards: Business, Shop, Gym, Talents, Hobbies, Properties, Subscriptions, Vacations, Social Media, Preferences.
- Each opens a “Coming soon” modal. Include a “Back to Home” button.

NEWS PAGE
- Route: /news
- List 6–10 seeded headlines (title, snippet, time) with unread dots.
- “Mark all read” button. News is separate from Inbox.

HEADER SIM CONTROL (REPLACE +1w)
- REMOVE all +1w buttons.
- Add pixel “>>” button top-right in header.
- Tapping opens Sim Modal with:
    • Sim next week
    • Sim N weeks (input 1–8)
    • Sim to end of season
    • Cancel
- On confirm: advance weeks via existing progression; show toast “Simmed X week(s).”

STATS STRIP SAFETY
- Stats strip (Energy, Mood, Clout, Chemistry, Health, Reputation) must always be fully visible.
- Add bottom padding to scroll area equal to stats strip height + safe-area inset, so nothing overlaps the bottom tab bar.

DATA (NON-BREAKING)
- Optional new key: hd:news = [{ id, title, body, dateISO, read }].

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- Main Menu = Play / Load / Roster Editor / Settings only (no Inbox).
- Settings from Main Menu stays in no-save mode; never drops user into game; returns to Main Menu.
- Guarded routes block access without active save and redirect to Load/New with toast.
- Home quick row = Standings, Schedule, Dash, News (no Team/Social duplicates).
- /dash exists with placeholder grid; /news exists with unread dots + “Mark all read”.
- Header uses “>>” Sim modal; sim options work and show confirmation toast.
- Stats strip is always readable; zero overlaps; safe-area respected.
- No console errors.
