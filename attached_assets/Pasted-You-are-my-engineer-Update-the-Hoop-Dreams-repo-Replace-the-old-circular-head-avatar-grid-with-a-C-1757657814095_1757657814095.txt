You are my engineer. Update the Hoop Dreams repo. Replace the old circular head avatar grid with a CLEAN 2D FULL-BODY CHARACTER SYSTEM (cartoon style with clear facial features; NOT pixel art). No gameplay changes—this is art + UI wiring.

STACK: Vite + React + TypeScript. Keep current routes. Start dev server when done.

GOALS
- Flow: /new → /customize → /builder → Start Career → /home.
- One layered 2D character (portrait + full-body) that previews live, persists to localStorage, and renders everywhere (load slots, home, team, inbox/social).
- Hide the bottom tab bar on pre-game routes (/, /new, /customize, /builder, /load, /settings). Tabs only show in-game.

ART DIRECTION (2D, CLEAN)
- Crisp mobile-game cartoon with soft shading, anti-aliased edges (no pixelation).
- PNG assets with transparency. Two canvases:
  • Portrait (head+shoulders) 256×256
  • Full-body (neutral stand) 384×512
- Jersey/shorts should be tintable by team color.

FILES & FOLDERS (create if missing; placeholder PNGs are fine)
- /public/assets/characters/portrait/{layer}/{variant}.png
- /public/assets/characters/full/{layer}/{variant}.png
Layer order (top → bottom):
  accessory (none|headband|goggles)
  hair (short|fade|afro|braids|buzz|curly)
  brows (straight|angled)
  eyes (default|focused)
  nose (small|medium)
  mouth (neutral|smile)
  head (skin: light|tan|brown|dark)
  jersey (grayscale for tint)
  shorts (grayscale for tint)
  legs (skin)
  socks
  shoes

COMPONENTS
1) src/components/character/CharacterPreview.tsx
   - Props type:
     export type CharacterLook = {
       skin:'light'|'tan'|'brown'|'dark';
       hair:'short'|'fade'|'afro'|'braids'|'buzz'|'curly';
       brows:'straight'|'angled';
       eyes:'default'|'focused';
       nose:'small'|'medium';
       mouth:'neutral'|'smile';
       accessory:'none'|'headband'|'goggles';
       jerseyColor:string; shortsColor:string; teamNumber?:number;
     }
   - Renders portrait OR full-body by layering PNGs absolutely in a fixed canvas.
   - Tint jersey/shorts from grayscale using <canvas> “multiply”; cache tinted bitmaps.

2) src/components/character/CharacterFull.tsx
   - Full-body convenience wrapper used on /customize and /builder.

ROUTES & UI
- /new (Create Player): on submit, go to /customize (do NOT jump straight to builder).
- /customize (Character Creator):
  • Large CharacterFull preview.
  • Controls: Skin Tone, Hair Style, Brows, Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Accessory, Jersey Color, Shorts Color.
  • Buttons: Randomize, Back, Continue → /builder.
  • Save to localStorage key hd:player.look.
- /builder (Player Builder):
  • Pin the SAME full-body preview near attributes.
  • Keep attribute UI; Start Career saves slot then goes to /home.
- /home, /team, /load, inbox/social: use portrait variant as the avatar (scaled cleanly).

DATA
- Extend hd:player to include:
  look: CharacterLook; number:number; dominantHand:'R'|'L';
- On team select at /new:
  look.jerseyColor = team.primary; look.shortsColor = team.secondary ?? darken(team.primary,12%);
- Save look inside each save slot snapshot; load restores it.

NPC LOOKS
- src/utils/characters.ts → export function generateRandomLook(seed?:string):CharacterLook
  • Deterministic by seed (e.g., `${teamId}-${index}`) for roster teammates and opponents.

PRE/IN-GAME NAV
- Ensure bottom tab bar is hidden on /, /new, /customize, /builder, /load, /settings (fix leakage on Settings when opened from main menu).

PERFORMANCE
- Preload active layer images; use will-change: transform; no console errors.

ACCEPTANCE
- /customize shows clear-face full-body character with live updates.
- /builder shows the same character beside attributes.
- Portraits appear sharp across home/team/load/inbox/social.
- Looks persist across saves/loads; NPCs use deterministic random looks.
- Bottom tabs never appear on pre-game routes.

Implement, run the dev server, and print the local URL.
