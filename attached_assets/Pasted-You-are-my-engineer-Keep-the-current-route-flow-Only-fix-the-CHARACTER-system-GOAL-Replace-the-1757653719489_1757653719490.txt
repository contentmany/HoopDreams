You are my engineer. Keep the current route flow. Only fix the CHARACTER system.

GOAL
- Replace the avatar "grid of faces" and the circular head preview with a single, full-body **pixel character** built from layered sprites (skin + hair + eyes + headband + jersey).
- The new character appears live on /customize, /new (small preview), and /builder (small preview in Player Info).

ASSETS (create simple placeholders if not present)
- /public/assets/char/skin/skin-1.png ... skin-6.png  (6 tones)
- /public/assets/char/hair/hair-1.png ... hair-10.png (short, fade, afro, braids, buzz, curly, twists, locs, shag, bald)
- /public/assets/char/eyes/eyes-1.png ... eyes-3.png  (default, sharp, soft)
- /public/assets/char/headband/hb-1.png ... hb-4.png (off, white, black, team)
- /public/assets/char/jersey/jersey-1.png ... jersey-4.png (neutral, teamA, teamB, white)
Sprite target 96×128 or 128×160. Ensure `image-rendering: pixelated;` everywhere these render.

FILES TO ADD/EDIT
1) src/features/character/CharacterPreview.tsx
   - Props: { size?: 'sm'|'lg'; appearance: Appearance; teamColor?: string }
   - Renders layered <img> in a fixed canvas box (no circular mask).
   - Add CSS: container uses `image-rendering: pixelated;` and centers sprite.

2) src/types/appearance.ts
   export type Appearance = {
     skinTone: number;   // 1..6
     hairStyle: number;  // 1..10
     hairColor: 'black'|'dark-brown'|'brown'|'blonde'|'red'|'grey';
     eyes: number;       // 1..3
     headband: number;   // 1..4  (1 = off)
     jersey: number;     // 1..4
   };

3) src/state/player.ts  (or equivalent store/utils)
   - Extend draft player with `appearance: Appearance`.
   - localStorage key remains **hd:player**; appearance nested inside.
   - Helper: `getDraftPlayer()`, `saveDraftPlayer(partial)`, `getActivePlayer()`.

4) /customize page: REPLACE UI with pixel creator
   - Left/top: large **CharacterPreview** (size="lg").
   - Right/below: Rows with big ◀ ▶ arrows to cycle options:
     • Skin Tone (1–6)
     • Hair Style (1–10)
     • Hair Color (list above)
     • Headband (Off/White/Black/Team)
     • Eyes (1–3)
     • Jersey (Neutral/Team A/Team B/White)
   - Above arrows, keep First Name + Last Name inputs (bind to draft).
   - Small actions: **Randomize** (appearance only) and **Reset**.
   - Bottom buttons:
     • Main Menu → '/'
     • Continue to Builder → '/builder'
   - Persist every change immediately into `hd:player.appearance`.

5) /new page:
   - REMOVE any avatar grid.
   - Show a small **CharacterPreview** if `hd:player.appearance` exists; else a silhouette.
   - Keep your existing Position/Archetype/Height/Team fields.
   - Keep the button that sends the user to **/customize** to edit look.

6) /builder page:
   - At the top of Player Info, show **CharacterPreview size="sm"** using the saved appearance.
   - No other flow changes.

7) Styling
   - Ensure NO circular image masks are applied to the preview (remove any `border-radius:50%` around character images).
   - Add `.pixel { image-rendering: pixelated; }` and apply to all layers.
   - No bottom nav on /customize or /new.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- /customize shows a full-body pixel character (not a face in a circle) and updates live with arrows.
- Name fields + appearance persist to `hd:player`.
- /new shows the small preview and **no** avatar grid.
- /builder shows the small preview in Player Info.
- All character images are crisp (pixelated), no overlaps, and no bottom nav on pre-game routes.
